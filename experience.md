## [Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence]{:target="_blank"}, Research Fellow

- I work on algorithms for 3d reconstruction from single image / video with the end goal of estimating [anthropometric measurements of neonates]{:target="_blank"}
- I own the entire data annotation pipeline with the goals of creating useful annotations for images of neonates collected in hospitals.
- My team is one of 34 teams (and the only one from developing countries) that have qualified to the [$5M IBM AI XPrize]{:target="_blank"}
- Founder and convener of the weekly reading group series where we discuss latest research in Artificial Intelligence 

## [Machine and Language Learning Lab, IISc]{:target="_blank"}, Research Assitant
Mentor - Dr. Partha Talukdar

- Built a domain specific data acquisition platform involving components such as a crawler, classifier, expander to create a domain specific corpus from the web given limited amounts of training data. Developed a knowledge graph based Positive Unlabeled (PU) classifier in the process. [Used Sparkler, Apache Solr, Apache Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes]
- Developed algorithms to jointly learn embeddings from knowledge graphs and text in a multi task setting so as to improve performance on a variety of tasks (link prediction, entity linking, relation extraction)


## [Apache Software Foundation]{:target="_blank"}, Google Summer of Code '17
Mentor - Mr. Trevor Grant

- Contributed the DBSCAN algorithm to the clustering submodule in Apache Mahout

## [Boomerang Commerce]{:target="_blank"}, Software Engineering Intern
Mentor - Mr. Satish Thakur

- Built an automated employee account management platform to manage all employee accounts
- Built a dashboard to create, update, delete and manage employee accounts and respective access permissions
- Wrote unit tests and pushed the platform to production

## [Machine Vision Lab]{:target="_blank"}, Research Intern
Mentor - Dr. Jagdish Lal Raheja
- Developed a system to collect real time data from sensors, camera and Kinect as part of developing an activity recognition system
- Continued the internship as a course project and developed classifier to classify activities in real time
