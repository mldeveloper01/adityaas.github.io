Hi! I'm Aditya. I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence]{:target="_blank"}, a independent, nonprofit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good.

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning. Specifically, interpretability of deep networks [[Read this!]]{:target="_blank"} and generative models interest me. 

Until about a few months ago, I was a research assistant at the [Machine and Language Learning (MALL) Lab]{:target="_blank"}, IISc Bangalore where I worked on constructing domain specific knowledge graphs and learning joint representations from knowledge graphs and text

I (briefly) contributed to [Apache Mahout]{:target="_blank"} as part of the Google Summer of Code '17 where I worked on the design and implementation of distributed [DBSCAN]{:target="_blank"}

In a previous life, I was an undergraduate student in Computer Science at [BITS Pilani]{:target="_blank"} where I worked with [Dr. Poonam Goyal]{:target="_blank"} at the [Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies (ADAPT) Lab]{:target="_blank"} on building large scale distributed algorithms for clustering (think billions of data points), [Dr. Jagdish Raheja]{:target="_blank"} at the Machine Vision Lab in CSIR-CEERI, Pilani on fall detection in elderly people and [Dr. Lavika Goel]{:target="_blank"} at the [Multimedia and HCI Lab]{:target="_blank"} on nature inspired swarm optimization algorithms [[paper]]{:target="_blank"}
