## Parallel Clustering Algorithms for Big Data 
Advisor: Dr. Poonam Goyal
* Designed and developed a parallel spatial clustering algorithm that scales to a billion data points. Benchmarked the algorithm on various million/billion sized datasets and achieved 100x speedup

## Speeding up Image Segmentation Algorithms - [Github](https://github.com/AdityaAS/FoodSense)
Advisor: Dr. Lavika Goel
* Developed a hybrid optimization algorithm and applied the algorithm to make image segmentation efficient
Our paper "Hybridization of Moth Flame Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm and its Application to detection of Food Quality" was accepted at the Intelligent Systems Conference (Intellisys) 2017, held in London, UK

## Activity Recognition using Cameras, Sensors and Kinect 
Advisor: Dr. Jagdish Lal Raheja
* Developed vision based models for Activity Recognition identifying 6 basic activities (Standing, Sitting, Walking, Lying, Bending, Falling) with emphasis on Fall
